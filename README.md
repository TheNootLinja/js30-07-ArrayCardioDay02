# Javascript 30 day 07

This was another pretty easy one as I have never had problems with array methods especially reading through the documentation. It definitely makes me realize how important and powerful these methods we can use for arrays are. I did the project before watching the video and the only thing that changed after watching was that I thought I was using splice wrong but when it is wrapped in a console.log directly, it only outputs the comment you are getting rid of.
